# 🚭 Stop Smoking Motivator - LLM Vibe-Coding Comparison

A comprehensive comparison of three leading AI models implementing a single-page web application from a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## 📋 Project Overview

This project evaluates the coding capabilities of three state-of-the-art AI models by having them implement the same web application: a **Stop Smoking Motivator**. Each model receives the same PRD and is tasked with creating a self-contained, single-page HTML application.

### 🔄 Iterative Approach

This comparison uses an **iterative development approach** where each model will go through multiple iterations to refine their implementations. The first iteration focuses on core functionality, with subsequent iterations addressing feedback, bug fixes, and feature enhancements. Each iteration is saved as `index-N.html` where N is the iteration number.

### 🎯 Application Features

The Stop Smoking Motivator is a privacy-first web app that helps recent quitters stay motivated by showing:

- **Real-time Progress Tracking** - Live counters for time smoke-free, cigarettes avoided, and money saved
- **Health Benefits Timeline** - 21 physiological milestones with progress visualization
- **Motivational Content** - Rotating inspirational quotes and achievement celebrations
- **Share Functionality** - URL-based progress sharing with no server requirements
- **Multi-currency Support** - Thailand (฿) and USA ($) pricing

### 🤖 Models Under Comparison

| Model | Version | Provider | Status |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| **o3** | Latest | OpenAI | 🔄 Iteration 1 Complete |
| **Claude Sonnet** | 4.0 | Anthropic | 🔄 Iteration 1 Complete |
| **Gemini** | 2.5 Pro | Google | � Ready for Iteration 1 |

## 📊 Implementation Tracking

### Iteration Results

| Model | Iteration | Status | Key Achievements | Issues/Gaps | Overall Score |
|-------|-----------|--------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **o3** | 1 | | | | /10 |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.0** | 1 | | | | /10 |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | 1 | | | | /10 |

*Note: Scores will be updated as implementations are completed and tested.*

### Evaluation Criteria

Each implementation will be scored (1-10) across these dimensions:

- **Functionality** - Core features working as specified
- **Design Adherence** - Following PRD design guidelines
- **Code Quality** - Clean, maintainable, well-structured code
- **Performance** - Loading speed and responsiveness
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance and usability
- **Innovation** - Creative improvements beyond requirements

```

## 🎨 Technical Requirements

Based on the PRD, each implementation must:

- **Single File** - Complete app in one `index.html` file
- **No Dependencies** - Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only
- **Offline Capable** - Works without internet after initial load
- **Mobile Responsive** - Mobile-first design with desktop optimization
- **Performance** - First Contentful Paint < 0.5s on 3G Fast
- **Privacy First** - No external network requests (optional analytics)

### Core Features Checklist

- [ ] Quit data input (days, hours, cigarettes/day)
- [ ] Country selector (Thailand 🇹🇭 / USA 🇺🇸)
- [ ] Real-time progress engine with live counters
- [ ] 21-milestone health benefits timeline
- [ ] Motivational quote rotation
- [ ] Share functionality with URL encoding
- [ ] Modal details for milestone information
- [ ] Responsive design (mobile-first)
- [ ] Data persistence (localStorage)
- [ ] Accessibility features

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Testing an Implementation

1. Navigate to the desired model's folder (e.g., `o3/`, `sonnet4/`, `gemini/`)
2. Open `index-1.html` (or the desired iteration) in your web browser
3. Enter your quit data and explore the features
4. Test sharing functionality and responsive design

### Evaluation Process

1. **Functional Testing** - Verify all features work as specified
2. **Design Review** - Compare visual design against PRD guidelines
3. **Code Analysis** - Review code structure, quality, and maintainability
4. **Performance Testing** - Measure loading times and responsiveness
5. **Accessibility Audit** - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## 📝 Notes

- All implementations use the same PRD as input
- No additional guidance or corrections provided to models
- Focus on "vibe-coding" - how well models interpret and implement requirements
- Emphasis on single-turn completeness rather than iterative refinement
