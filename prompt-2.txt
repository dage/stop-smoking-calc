# Stop Smoking Motivator - Iteration 2: PRD Compliance & Bug Fixes

## Task Overview
Analyze the provided screenshot of your iteration 1 implementation and create an improved `index-2.html` that better matches the PRD specifications.

## Your Task (in order):

### a.) Analyze the Screenshot
- Compare what you see in the screenshot against the PRD requirements
- Identify missing features, incorrect implementations, or visual bugs
- Note any deviations from the specified design guidelines

### b.) Fix PRD Differences
Review the PRD and ensure your iteration 2 includes:
- **Quit Data Input**: Days/hours fields, country selector (🇹🇭/🇺🇸), pack price auto-fill
- **Live Stats Widget**: Large monospace counters (⏳ time, 🚭 cigarettes avoided, 💰 money saved)
- **Benefits Timeline**: 21 milestone cards with proper states (completed/in-progress/upcoming)
- **Share Functionality**: URL hash serialization for all input data
- **Design Guidelines**: Correct colors (#f2f4f6 bg, #ff6b6b accent, #2ecc71 success), card styling, system fonts

### c.) Fix Visual & Technical Bugs
- Ensure mobile responsiveness (mobile-first design)
- Fix any layout issues, broken counters, or missing functionality
- Improve accessibility and usability based on what you observe
- Ensure localStorage persistence works properly

### d.) Produce index-2.html
Create a complete, self-contained HTML file that:
- Maintains all working functionality from iteration 1
- Fixes identified PRD compliance issues
- Resolves any visual or technical bugs
- Works offline as a single file with no external dependencies

## Success Criteria
Your iteration 2 should demonstrate closer adherence to the PRD specifications while maintaining or improving the user experience from iteration 1.

Start by describing what you observe in the screenshot compared to the PRD, then provide your complete `index-2.html` implementation.
